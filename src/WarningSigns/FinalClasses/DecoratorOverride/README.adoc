== 1. Description

This example proves the claim that marking a class `final` is functionally useless.

== 2. File contents

* link:./ComponentInterface.php[`ComponentInterface`] : Each concrete feature class in this example implements this
 interface.
* link:./BaseClass.php[`BaseClass`] : A sample base class which is going to be extended.
* link:./ExtendedClass.php[`ExtendedClass`] : A class which is directly extending the `BaseClass`.
* link:./FinalClass.php[`FinalClass`] : A class which is extending `ExtendedClass` and is marked as `final`.
* link:./Decorator.php[`Decorator`] : Base implementation of the Decorator design pattern. The decorator practically
 "extends" the `FinalClass` and even implements the same interface. It then overrides the `operation` methods, just
 like classic inheritance would.
* link:./ConcreteDecorator.php[`ConcreteDecorator`] : Extends the `Decorator`, implements the same `ComponentInterface` and
 overrides the same `operation` method as any other feature class in this example. You can clearly see that you can
 extend anything indefinitely, regardless of whether a class is declared as `final` or not.
* link:./ClientClass.php[`ClientClass`] : Class which demonstrates the example.

== 3. Understanding and running tests

link:../../../../tests/WarningSigns/FinalClasses/DecoratorOverride/ClientClassTest.php[`ClientClassTest`] provides a
PHPUnit test case for this example. To confirm that the example works (and understand how), look at what each of the
classes return as result of the `operation` method and compare it with the expected result in the test case.
