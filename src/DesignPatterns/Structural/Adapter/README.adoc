== 1. Definition

____
Converts the interface of a class into another interface client expects. Adapter lets classes work together that
couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. [<<reference-1,1>>]
____

Or, in other words:
____
Use (in `ClientService`) any class (example: `ConcreteAdaptee`) implementing some interface (`AdapteeInterface`) as if
it implements another interface (`TargetInterface`) which is not compatible with the interface of that class
(`AdapteeInterface`).
____

== 2. Components

* *Adaptee* class or interface - A class or an interface which you want to use, but is incompatible with what the rest
of your code can use. This class or interface must not be modified (in the context of implementing an adapter). The most
obvious example is a class or an interface which is imported from a 3rd party (Composer) library and which you can not
modify, but have to use it in a _Client Service_ through an incompatible interface. Also note that you don't generally
have control of whether the _Adaptee_ is a class or interface - that might be defined by a third party library which
you are trying to use.
* *Target* interface - An interface which _Client Service_ uses to perform some operations and run business logic. The
Adaptee must be adapted to be compatible with this interface. Can have one or more _Concrete Classes_ implementing it.
_Adapter_ must also implement this interface.
* *Client Service* class - A class which uses a concrete implementation of the _Target_ interface in order to perform
some operations and run business logic.
* **Adapter** class - A class which makes the _Adaptee_ compatible with the _Target interface_. Adapter class must be
fully compatible with the _Target interface_, because _Client Service_ expects it to be. In case of a two-way adapter
(explained and demonstrated later), it should also be fully compatible with the _Adaptee_ as well.

== 3. Types of adapters and implementation approaches

There are several types of adapters defined in theory [<<reference-1, 1>>]:

* link:TheoreticalExamples/ObjectAdapter/[Object Adapter] - The only possible way to implement the Adapter in PHP.
* link:TheoreticalExamples/ClassAdapter/[Class Adapter] - Not possible to implement in PHP, because it requires multiple
inheritance. Covered by this repository simply because there are examples online which claim to provide a workaround,
which is covered on the linked page (with examples, of course).
* Two-way Adapter - Not possible to implement in PHP, because it requires multiple inheritance. Not covered in this
repository.
