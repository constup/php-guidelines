== 1. Definition

____
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing
for extending functionality.[<<reference-1,1>>]
____

Or, in other words:
____
When you use composition while extending an interface of the object your class is depending on, you can add a function
to a class and expand its functionality while keeping the compatibility with the interface.
____

== 2. Components

* *Component* interface - An interface of a component to which you want to add a method.
* *Concrete component* class - Concrete class which implements the _Component interface_.
* *Decorator* class - A class which implements the _Component interface_ and at the same time has a property of the same
type (_ComponentInterface_)
* *Concrete Decorator* class - Extends _Decorator_
