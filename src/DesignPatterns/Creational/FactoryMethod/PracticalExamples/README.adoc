[#abstract-creator-internal-use-of-factory-method]
== 1. Abstract Creator; internal use of Factory Method

=== 1.1 Links

* link:./AbstractCreatorInternalUse[Link to the example.]
* link:../../../../Command/DesignPatterns/Creational/FactoryMethod/PracticalExamples/AbstractCreatorInternalUseCommand.php[Use of the example in a Symfony Command.]

=== 1.2. Commands

* Execute Symfony command:

[source, bashproshellscript]
----
  php bin/console design-patterns:factory-method:practical:abstract-creator-internal-use
----

* Execute in Docker:

[source, bashproshellscript]
----
  docker exec -it constup_php_guidelines php /usr/src/app/bin/console design-patterns:factory-method:practical:abstract-creator-internal-use
----

=== 1.3. Features of this example

* Buttons are products UI classes are producing in their factory methods. UI classes are Creators in this case. Produced
 buttons are then used in the main functionality of UI classes.
* See link:../TheoreticalExamples/README.adoc#abstract-creator-internal-use-of-a-factory-method[Abstract Creator; internal use of Factory Method]
 for more theoretical details (with theoretical example equivalent).

[#more-than-one-factory-method]
== 2. More than one Factory Method

=== 2.1. Links

* link:./MoreThanOneFactoryMethod[Link to the example.]
* link:../../../../Command/DesignPatterns/Creational/FactoryMethod/PracticalExamples/MoreThanOneFactoryMethodCommand.php[Use of the example in a Symfony Command.]

=== 2.2. Commands

* Execute Symfony command:

[source, bashproshellscript]
----
  php bin/console design-patterns:factory-method:practical:more-than-one-factory-method
----

* Execute in Docker:

[source, bashproshellscript]
----
  docker exec -it constup_php_guidelines php /usr/src/app/bin/console design-patterns:factory-method:practical:more-than-one-factory-method
----

=== 2.3. Features of this example

* UI classes (our Creators) are producing different types of Buttons and Checkboxes in two separate factory methods.
 These products are then used in the main functionality of UI classes.
* See link:../TheoreticalExamples/README.adoc#more-than-one-factory-method[More than one Factory Method] for more theoretical
 details (with theoretical example equivalent).
