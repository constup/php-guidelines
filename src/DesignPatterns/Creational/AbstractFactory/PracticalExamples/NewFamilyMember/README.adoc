== 1. Abstract Factory

====
*Examples:*

* The original state of the objects: link:../OriginalExample[OriginalExample]
** Products: `Button`, `Checkbox`;
** Family:
*** Operating system (`Linux`, `Windows`);
* Adding a new family member: link:./[NewFamilyMember]
** Added `Android` Operating System family member
====

=== 1.1. New files

* Create Concrete Products for the new family member (`AndroidButton`, `AndroidCheckbox`);
* Create Concrete Family Factory for the new family member (`AndroidFactory`);

=== 1.2. Modified

* Add support for a new family member in the `FactoryResolver`;

=== 1.3. Unchanged

* All code related to existing families (`Windows`, `Linux`);
* Product Interfaces (`ButtonInterface`, `CheckboxInterface`);
* `ClientService`;

=== 1.4. Conclusion

This is what the family classification is all about - being able to easily create new family members in their own
separate files without changing the existing code. However, we still have an issue of having to implement the same set
of properties, a constructor and related utility methods (get, set, with,…) in the new family member, regardless of
whether the properties are exactly the same as in other family members or not.

== 2. Service Bundle

====
*Examples:*

* The original state of the objects: link:../../Alternatives/ServiceBundle/OriginalExample[OriginalExample]
** Products: `Button`, `Checkbox`;
** Family:
*** Operating system (`Linux`, `Windows`);
* Adding a new property: link:../../Alternatives/ServiceBundle/NewFamilyMember[NewFamilyMember]
** Added `Android` Operating System Family member
====

=== 2.1. New files

* Create Concrete Service classes for the new family member (`AndroidFactory`, `AndroidRenderService`);

=== 2.2. Modified

* Add support for a new family member in the `FamilyResolver`;

=== 2.3. Unchanged

* All code related to existing families (Windows, Linux);
* Products (`Button`, `Checkbox`);
* `ClientService`;

=== 2.4. Conclusion

Service Bundle approach not only has the same level of convenience when it comes to implementing a new family member as
Abstract Factory approach does - it also eliminates the need to repeat implementation of properties, a constructor and
utility methods (get, set, with,…) if the set of properties is the same as in other family members.
