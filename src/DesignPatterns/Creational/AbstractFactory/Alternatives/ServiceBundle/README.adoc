== 1. Introduction

An alternative approach, which can solve some problems introduced by the theoretical definition of Abstract Factory
design pattern, eliminates encapsulation and uses an architecture based on immutable data objects and service classes.
This approach also solves problems with the responsibility of the design pattern itself.

== 2. Definition

____
A bundle of services grouped together, for easier use in other places in the code. Grouping and classification of
objects of the same type is based on values of their properties.

A Service Bundle provides a way to separate the application into flows, with each flow having its own set of services
working with different types and variations of immutable data objects. Flows can then be implemented into a Client
Service, which isolates internal implementation of services and data objects in the flow from the rest of the
application. The rest of the application can then use Client Services  to create, use and manipulate data objects
without knowing the internal implementation of bundled services or data objects.
____

[NOTE]
====
Please note that bundling of services is not limited to families only (in the original sense of the word taken from
Abstract Factories). A Service Bundle is a lot more flexible.
====

[NOTE]
====
Please note that Service Bundle is *not* a creational design pattern, as Abstract Factory claims to be. It works with
any type of service, not only factories.

[#_3_components]
== 3. Components

* *Concrete Immutable Data Product* - link:./OriginalExample/Family/OperatingSystem/Product/Button.php[`Button`],
link:./OriginalExample/Family/OperatingSystem/Product/Button.php[`Checkbox`] - An immutable data class which represents an
equivalent of a Concrete Product in the original definition of the Abstract Factory design pattern. Concrete Family
Factories are producing different variations of this Product, depending on which family the produced object belongs to.
Family (and subfamilies) are implemented as properties (`$operatingSystem`, `$desktopEnvironment`) of the Concrete
Product. These classes do not have any service methods and are made of data properties and, potentially, utility methods
(`get`, `with`,... properties).
* *Family Service Interface* -
link:./OriginalExample/Family/Interfaces/Service/FamilyFactoryInterface.php[`FamilyFactoryInterface`],
link:./OriginalExample/Family/Interfaces/Service/FamilyRenderServiceInterface.php[`RenderFamilyServiceInterface`] -
Declares methods which can be used on a certain family of Products. Concrete Family Services are implementing this
interface. This includes Factories as well as other services.
* *Concrete Family Service* -
link:./OriginalExample/Family/OperatingSystem/Service/Factory/LinuxFactory.php[`LinuxFactory`],
link:./OriginalExample/Family/OperatingSystem/Service/Factory/WindowsFactory.php[`WindowsFactory`],
link:./OriginalExample/Family/OperatingSystem/Service/Render/LinuxRenderService.php[`LinuxRenderService`],
link:./OriginalExample/Family/OperatingSystem/Service/Render/WindowsRenderService.php[`WindowsRenderService`] - Concrete
implementation of a Family Service Interface. Contains definitions of methods which can be used on a certain family of
Products. Depending on the responsibility of a Concrete Family Service, it can include factory methods (if the service
is a factory) or other service methods.
* *Service Bundle* - link:./OriginalExample/Family/FamilyServiceBundle.php[`FamilyServiceBundle`] -
An instance of this class contains all services related to a family. You can wire up compatible services for a
particular family during instantiation and pass the created instance to the Client Service. *Note:* Although a Service
Bundle is used to hold services related to a particular family of products in the link:./OriginalExample[Original Example],
Service Bundles can also be used for grouping services based on any classification. For example, if you want to have a
set of services which are processing only Buttons, you can group them in a Service Bundle.
* *Client Service* - link:./OriginalExample/ClientService.php[`ClientService`] - A client service which uses an instance
of a Family Bundle to produce and perform operations on Products. The code inside the Client Service works with service
methods, which have their common declarations defined in the Family Service Interface, and does not know which concrete
services (including factories) are used.
* *Family Resolver* - link:./OriginalExample/Family/FamilyResolver.php[`FamilyResolver`] - Similar to the Factory
Resolver in the original definition of Abstract Factory design pattern, Family Factory resolver resolves which Concrete
Family Services will be passed to the Client Service. The product of the resolver is a wired up instance of a Family
Bundle which is then passed to a Client Service. This can either be a separate class (as in our example) or it can be
wired up in the Dependency Injection Container (which, again, generates and caches a resolver class).

=== 3.1. Optional components

Since the introduction of link:https://php.watch/versions/8.0/union-types[union types], grouping Products by using
Interfaces became optional. Of course, it still is useful in many cases to use Interfaces.

* *Product Interface* - link:./OriginalExample/Family/Interfaces/Product/ButtonInterface.php[`ButtonInterface`],
link:./OriginalExample/Family/Interfaces/Product/CheckboxInterface.php[`CheckboxInterface`] - Product Interfaces are
blank "marker" interfaces which serve one purpose - to classify Products by their type. Since Service Bundle have a
capability to have only one Concrete Product, if Product's properties are the same between families and subfamilies
Service Bundle will have only one Concrete Product for all families and subfamilies. However, when there are slight
differences between properties in different families, Product Interface can be used to mark and group Concrete Products
with a common Interface. They are also used when there is a need to create more complex classifications of Products in
order to implement features which are common to only a specific set of families, subfamilies and/or family members.
Concrete Products are implementing these interfaces.

== 4. Benefits and problems

=== 4.1. Benefits

==== 4.1.1. A single class for all objects with the same properties

Classification of objects based on the value of their properties is done where it should be done - at runtime. This
enables using *a single class* for all objects of a specific Product belonging to a family, if the properties of
(theoretical) Products belonging to different families and/or subfamilies are the same. There is no forced duplication
of property definitions, constructors and utility methods(`getProperty()`, `withProperty()`,â€¦ if you are using them),
like in the Abstract Factory design pattern.

On the other hand, you are completely free to create and use multiple unrelated families with objects which have
different properties - and still use the same Family Service Interfaces. You can do that *only when and if needed*. Take
a look at the link:./NewFamily[`NewFamily`] example for more details.

==== 4.1.2. Architectural consistency

Factories are services like any other. This is why `FamilyFactoryInterface` and `RenderFamilyServiceInterface`, along
with their concrete implementations, are architecturally fundamentally the same. One produces objects
(`produceButton()`, `produceCheckbox()`), while the other performs some other operation over objects (`renderButton()`,
`renderCheckbox()`). This promotes consistency in the code. If a new service needs to be implemented, you have the exact
way how to do it properly just by looking at the implementation of Factories (or other services).

Contrary to Service Bundles, Abstract Factory design pattern promotes the use of encapsulation - but it's not even
consistent at doing that. Factories, even though they are services like any other, are treated as a special case, while
other operations over an object are encapsulated within the Concrete Product class.

Additionally, any operation on any set or subset of objects can be done by using <<_3_components, Components described
in Section 3>>. Theoretical definition of Abstract Factories, on the other hand, does not support operations on objects
of different types and more complex grouping of operations on objects.

==== 4.1.3. Truly implements and promotes single responsibility of classes and interfaces

Unlike the original Abstract Factory design pattern implemented with encapsulation, this approach truly separates
classes and interfaces by their responsibility. Multiple different and unrelated services, each of them potentially with
their own dependencies and support methods, are not crammed up in a single Concrete Product class. They are separated
into their own classes, without sacrificing the ability of a Client Service to use them, and without introducing
additional resolvers.

==== 4.1.4. Single responsibility of a design pattern

In practice, the Abstract Factory design pattern is both responsible for creating objects and managing (classifying)
services, by forcing them into same (family) classes - but its defined as a Creational Design Pattern. This breaks
single responsibility of the design pattern itself and introduces problems. Service Bundle, on the other hand, is just
that - a bundle of services grouped together for easier use in other places in the code.

==== 4.1.5. Direct serialization without meta-data

By including the family name property in the definition of Service Bundles, direct serialization, deserialization,
normalization and denoramlization are possible, without depending on external parameters.

== 5. Key Features

In order for the Service Bundle to be a viable alternative to the Abstract Factory design pattern, it must have the same
set of key features (listed link:../../README.adoc#_5_key_fetures[here] for the Abstract Factory design pattern).

* Object creation and use is separated from the rest of the code, with Client Service acting as a proxy.
* A single parameter (`FamilyServiceBundle`) passed to a Client Service for the whole family of objects is all the
information needed to run Client Service's methods.
* A single resolver is used to define the flow and classes which will be used in the Client Service.
* Client Service is able to create and use all types of objects in the family and subfamilies.
* Client Service method definition does not change when adding a new:
** property to Concrete Products;
** family member;
** family;
** product;
** subfamily;
* Ability to categorize objects and determine their families and subfamilies at runtime.
* Can use default serializers/deserializers, normalizers/denormalizers.
* Types of objects can be identified in other data formats (JSON, CSV, XML,â€¦)

== 6. Conclusions

Service Bundle is a better defined, more suitably named, more flexible and more powerful alternative to Abstract
Factories. It provides the same set of key features without changing the way it's used by the rest of the code (compared
to Abstract Factory). The examples provided in this repository are showing that Service Bundle can perform the same
operations and provide support for the same expansions and modification of Products and Services as the Abstract Factory
does, without being inferior to Abstract Factories in any situation. In fact, it also supports grouping and
classification of services in much more general way, compared to Abstract Factory design pattern and its fixed grouping
by a single (family) attribute. Service Bundle also promotes architectural consistency and single responsibility of
Services.
