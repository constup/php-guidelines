____
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

____

[#_2_practical_definition]
== 2. Practical definition

In order to see what Abstract Factories really are and how to fix some problems of them, we will take a look at the
link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample[practical example].

____
Abstract Factory design pattern is nothing more than a method of taking a common property out of different objects,
removing it and classifying object by their *name* instead - by using values of the removed property for naming the
Concrete Factories and Concrete Products.
____

Our link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample[practical example] takes a property which defines the operating system,
removes it from the `Button` and `Checkbox` and creates individual concrete classes based on the value of the missing
`operatingSystem` property: `LinuxButton`, `WindowsButton`, `LinuxCheckbox`, `WindowsCheckbox`.

[#_3_components]
== 3. Components

* *Product Interface* -
(link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/ButtonInterface.php[`ButtonInterface`],
link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/CheckboxInterface.php[`CheckboxInterface`]) - Interfaces of Products which will
be produced by the Abstract Factory design pattern.
* *Concrete Products* - (
link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/Family/OperatingSystem/Linux/LinuxButton.php[`LinuxButton`],
link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/Family/OperatingSystem/Linux/LinuxCheckbox.php[`LinuxCheckbox`],
link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/Family/OperatingSystem/Windows/WindowsButton.php[`WindowsButton`],
link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/Family/OperatingSystem/Windows/WindowsCheckbox.php[`WindowsCheckbox`]) -
Concrete Products which will be produced by the Abstract Factory design pattern.
* *Abstract Factory* - (
link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/AbstractFactory.php[`AbstractFactory`]) - An Interface which defines factory
methods for each of the supported products. Concrete Factories will implement this interface.
* *Concrete Factories* - (
link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/Family/OperatingSystem/Linux/LinuxFactory.php[`LinuxFactory`],
link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/Family/OperatingSystem/Windows/WindowsFactory.php[`WindowsFactory`]) - Concrete
implementations of factories. Produces objects for a particular family.
* *Client Service* - (
link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/ClientService.php[`ClientService`]) - A client service which uses Abstract
Factory to produce objects of the same family. The code inside the Client Service works with abstractions and does not
know which Concrete Products are used. The rest of the code of your application (outside the classes and interfaces used
in the Abstract Factory design pattern) can use Client Services in order to build features which are independent of the
details of implementation of the Products. Details of implementation of Concrete Products can change, but it will not
affect the rest of the code.

== 4. Additional elements

=== 4.1. Factory resolver

In theory, the components listed above are all the components of the Abstract Factory design pattern. However, this
design pattern is mostly useless and does not produce anything - unless a Concrete Factory is passed to a Client
Service. There will rarely be a case where you are passing an instance of a Concrete Factory directly to the Client
Service, without first resolving which Concrete Factory to use (based on application logic, a value of some parameter,
environment variable, API response or some other configuration value). Thus, one more component must be present:

* *Factory Resolver* - (link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/FactoryResolver.php[`FactoryResolver`]) - Resolves
which Concrete Factory instance will be passed to the Client Service. This can either be a separate class (as in our
example) or it can be wired up in the Dependency Injection Container (which, again, generates and caches a resolver
class).

=== 4.2. Family name property

One additional element, which is not mentioned in the literature, is directly related to the
<<_2_practical_definition,2. Practical definition>> - *the property holding the information about which family the
object belongs to*. Omitting this property from Concrete Products does not have direct consequences on other components
of the Abstract Factory design pattern. However, it creates many problems in other parts of the application and can even
impact third-party applications.

====
*More about the family name property*, the problems when family name property is missing and possible optional
solutions is available on a dedicated *link:./doc/family_name_property.adoc[Family name property] page*.

[NOTE]
Don't get confused. The link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample[practical example] has a family property included by
default (`$operatingSystem` in link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/ButtonInterface.php[`ButtonInterface`] and
link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/CheckboxInterface.php[`CheckboxInterface`]). Almost every other example found
online or in literature will not contain, or even mention this property.
====

[#_5_key_fetures]
== 5. Key features

In order to present a viable alternative for Abstract Factory design pattern, a list of key features should be created.
The alternative must support all of them.

* Object creation and use is separated from the rest of the code, with Client Service acting as a proxy.
* A single parameter (`AbstractFactory`) passed to a Client Service for the whole family of objects is all the
 information needed to run Client Service's methods.
* A single resolver is used to define the flow and classes which will be used in the Client Service.
* Client Service is able to create and use all types of objects in the family and subfamilies.
* Client Service method definition does not change when adding a new:
** property to Concrete Products;
** family member;
** family;
** product;
** subfamily;
* _If family name property is present_:
** Ability to categorize objects and determine their families and subfamilies at runtime.
** Can use default serializers/deserializers, normalizers/denormalizers.
** Can be identified in other data formats (JSON, CSV, XML,â€¦)

== 6. Examples, expansions and working with Abstract Factories

In order to better understand Abstract Factory design pattern, its benefits, limitations and downsides and to find a
viable alternative which solves the issues of Abstract Factories, we will address several expansions and modifications.

The following topics are covered, each of them with examples which can be run in CLI:

* Adding a new property to a product (link:./PracticalExamples/AddProperty/[`AddProperty`])
* Creating a new family alongside the existing one (link:./PracticalExamples/NewFamily/[`NewFamily`])
* Adding a new family member to the existing family (link:./PracticalExamples/NewFamilyMember/[`NewFamilyMember`])
* Adding a new Product to the existing family (link:./PracticalExamples/NewProduct/[`NewProduct`])
* Adding a new subfamily to an existing family (link:./PracticalExamples/NewSubfamily/[`NewSubfamily`])
* And, finally, addressing the issues and limitations of Abstract Factory design pattern by trying to group common
 features between family and subfamily members (link:./PracticalExamples/CommonMethods/[`CommonMethods`])

All of these expansions and modifications are based on the
link:../AbstractFactory/PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/[`OriginalExample`] which is used as a base.

See each of the linked articles and its sample code for more details.

== 7. Benefits and problems

=== 7.1. Benefits

==== 7.1.1 Object creation and use is separated form the rest of the code

link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/ClientService.php[`ClientService`] accepts an instance of the
link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/AbstractFactory.php[`AbstractFactory`] interface.
link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/ClientService.php[`ClientService`] itself contains code which can be applied to
all objects which are produced by the link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/AbstractFactory.php[`AbstractFactory`]
and does not care about the implementation details of objects it's using.

This allows you to change implementation details of the objects covered with Abstract Factory without affecting the rest
of the code, since the rest of the code will use Client Service directly.

==== 7.1.2. A single resolver

When multiple types of objects and services exist in an application, one of the most complex and time-consuming tasks is
to decide which ones to use, under given conditions, and to enforce that rule strictly and consistently throughout the
application. This is true regardless of whether the objects are related or not.

As mentioned in the <<_3_components,3. Components>> section, there is one additional component which determines which
exact instance to pass to a link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/ClientService.php[`ClientService`], based on a
value of some parameter, - link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/FactoryResolver.php[`FactoryResolver`]. Of course,
this resolution does not have to be done by a dedicated class and can be delegated to a Service Container (Dependency
Injection Container).

The important part is
link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/FactoryResolver.php[`FactoryResolver`] is very important when trying to
understand one of the advantages of the Abstract Factory Design Pattern - having to resolve once which classes to use in
order to complete the whole series of operations is what really makes the code reusable, expandable and stable.

=== 7.2. Problems

==== 7.2.1. Naming

====
The term "Abstract Factory" does not describe the contents and purpose of this design pattern correctly.
====

===== 7.2.1.1. Abstract Factory is an interface, not an abstract class

There is a very clear and significant distinction between *abstract classes* and *interfaces*, not only in PHP -
but in object-oriented programming languages in general. However, that does not stop the authors of
<<reference-1,_"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"_>> to define the Abstract Factory with
the following:

____
AbstractFactory (WidgetFactory)
 - declares an interface for operations that create abstract product objects.
____

===== 7.2.1.2. There are no abstract factory classes in "Abstract Factory" design pattern

Not a single abstract class, whose purpose is to be a factory and producing objects, is among the components of the
"Abstract Factory" design pattern. When it comes to factories, the definition of the Abstract Factory design pattern
lists only the link:./PracticalExamples/OriginalExample/AbstractFactory.php[AbstractFactory] *interface* and *concrete
factory classes* which produce members of a family.

===== 7.2.1.3. Solution: better name - Family Factory Interface design pattern

* The main component of this design pattern is an *interface*. Everything else is built around it.
* The interface defines methods to *produce families* of objects - thus, the "Family Factory"

'''

==== 7.2.2. Encapsulation and unnecessary code repetition

The authors of <<reference-1,_"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"_>> are exclusively using
encapsulation while presenting the Abstract Factory design pattern. This is passed to other literature and online
guides. Encapsulation forces data and functionality to be in the same class, which leads to undesirable consequences.

Each family member must be implemented in a separate class, even if it has exactly the same properties as other family
members. Depending on the approach and mutability or immutability of your objects, classes which have exactly the same
properties must have the same property definitions, constructors and utility methods (`getProperty`, `setProperty`,
`withProperty`,â€¦) implemented. For 10 family members with 10 properties, this means 100 property definitions, 100
constructors and 100 of each of the utility methods which you want to have - a set of 10 repeated across 10 classes.

Even if you are going with a more modern approach, for example: immutable objects with readonly properties and
constructor property promotion, this still means that at least constructors with built-in property definitions will
be repeated, and in many cases expected to be exactly the same as others. Expecting something to be the same as some
other thing as a convention (not enforced in the code) leads to bugs which are difficult to trace, caused by typos,
botched copypasta or simply by working on someone else's code while not knowing that it should be the same.

===== 7.2.2.1. Clarification

The main functionality of each Concrete Product is contained in its service methods (`render()`) - methods which
actually do some work. Since Abstract Factory design pattern is classifying classes into families and subfamilies, each
family member must have their own unique implementation of each of the service methods. Therefore, each family member
must have its own class.

At the same time, because of encapsulation, each of these concrete classes contain data properties as well. Having data
properties means that you will also have constructors and utility methods (`getProperty`, `setProperty` and/or
`withProperty`, depending on desired mutability or immutability of your objects). These property definitions,
constructors and utility methods are usually the same for each family member.

Why "usually the same"? The only type of unique product-specific properties (not present in other family members) which
can be added to Concrete Products are the ones whose *values* must be set inside factory methods of Concrete
Factories. The most notable examples of such properties are family property (`$operatingSystem`) and subfamily property
(`$desktopEnvironment`). Because there is one factory method for producing all the Concrete Products in the same family,
the set of properties which can be passed directly from factory method arguments to constructors of Concrete Products is
fixed for the whole family/subfamily.

===== 7.2.2.2. Solution

Eliminate encapsulation. Use a combination of service classes and immutable objects. Take a look at
*link:./Alternatives/ServiceBundle[Service Bundle alternative]* for more details.

'''

==== 7.2.3. Encapsulation and breaking the Single Responsibility principle

When Encapsulation is used, along with the implementation of Abstract Factory design pattern, the grouping of service
methods (which actually perform some business logic, like `render()`) is based on the classification defined in the
Abstract Factory pattern. This is why you will have service methods grouped in classes like `LinuxButton` and
`WindowsButton`. The problem is - all service methods for a particular product, regardless of the fact that they may and
probably will belong to a completely different domain, have their own mutually unrelated sets of dependencies and need
to have their own support methods, are crammed up in that product's class. This promotes creation of *_monster
classes_*.

Even if domain is not the context in focus, and multiple service methods belonging to different domains are placed
inside a single Concrete Product class, the single responsibility principle is broken on the code architecture level as
well. Abstract Factory design pattern is a *creational design pattern*. Its purpose and focus are on creation of
objects - not on management and use of other service methods. Yet, it manages these methods and defines how to use them
by forcing the Client Service code to access these methods as members of families.

===== 7.2.3.1. Solution

Eliminate encapsulation. Use immutable data objects and place service methods in classes created based on their domain.
Examples:
link:./Alternatives/ServiceBundle/OriginalExample/Family/OperatingSystem/Service/Render/LinuxRenderService.php[`LinuxRenderService`]
and
link:./Alternatives/ServiceBundle/OriginalExample/Family/OperatingSystem/Service/Render/WindowsRenderService.php[`WindowsRenderService`].
Take a look at *link:./Alternatives/ServiceBundle[Service Bundles alternative]* for more details.

'''

==== 7.2.4. Services and service methods which break family classification

Abstract Factory design pattern forces classification by families and subfamilies. What if we need services and/or
service methods which should apply only on a subset of products which belong to only a subset of families? What if these
service methods should be exactly the same for affected products?

This subject is covered in a separate document (with examples) and is available at
link:./PracticalExamples/CommonMethods/[`CommonMethods`].

== 8. Alternatives

Service Bundle is a completely viable alternative, which also solves some problems of Abstract Factories. Read more
